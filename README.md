# Selenium Webdriver Demo Project

## About the project
This was one of my projects maintained while I was in Planit bootcamp training. Due to the very limited number in Planit Git, I have to move it here.

This is the lastest version, as I delete some unfinished parts.

This is my C# script for the website "Demo Web Shop".
